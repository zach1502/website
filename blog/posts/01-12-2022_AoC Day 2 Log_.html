                Rock Paper Scissors | AoC Day 2

            <p>
                I was not happy with my results for day 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made too many mistakes and I was forced to wait 5 minutes to send my next submission because I repeatedly made a mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
                The question was based around Rock Paper Scissors, 
                you are given a list of 2 characters representing your move and the opponent's move. 
                Opponent: A = Rock, B = Paper, C = Scissors.
                You: X = Rock, Y = Paper, Z = Scissors.
                You need to tally up your final score. 
                You gain 6 points if you win, 3 points if you tie, and 0 points if you lose.
                Additionally, whatever you played, you get 1 point if you play rock, 2pts if you play paper, and 3pts if you play scissors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This question wasn't hard at all but I made a critical mistake under the pressure of trying to finish the question in under 5 minutes.
                The mistake was simply because I wrote the Rock Paper Scissors logic incorrectly and 
                I kept spamming submissions under the impression I got it correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the very least, part 2 was really fast.
                It turns out that the character that represents your move wasn't the move you're supposed to make.
                Rather, it was the result you were trying to get. So X = loss, Y = tie and Z = win.
                I was able to make some adjustments and get the correct answer in just under 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                So to sum up the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took 18:26 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 7523. Part 2 took 22:58 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 5720.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now 11th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard, down from 10th.
                Mistakes slowed me down but I think it's an okay result. I just need to be more careful.
                As the days go on, the questions will test problem solving skills more and more and, test speed, less.
            </p>
