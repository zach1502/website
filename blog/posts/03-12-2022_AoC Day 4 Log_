                Today's question was about taking a list with 2 pairs of numbers on each lines.
                The first 2 numbers represent the first range. and the second 2 numbers represent the second range.
                The question was to find the number of lines that had one of the ranges completely inside the other range.
                For example, 4-5,1-10 would be line we would count. 4-5,2-4 would not be counted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The approach is straightforward, read in a line with stringstream. Make 4 variables, to store the 2 ranges.
                I named the numbers a and b for the first range, and c and d for the second range.
                I then checked if a is less than or equal to c, and b is greater than or equal to d or a is greater than or equal to c, and b is less than or equal to d.
                Or in english, if range 1 is a subset of range 2 or the other way around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that you will now have to consider partial overlaps.
                So, 4-5,2-4 would now be counted.
            </p>
            <p>
                I simply appended a bit of code that checks for c being between a and b, or d being between a and b and a being between c and d, or b being between c and d.
                And BAM! that's it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took an alright 15:33 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 7345. Part 2 took 18:23 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 6128.

                I am now 13th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard, up from 14th.
                There are now 104 people in leaderboard,
