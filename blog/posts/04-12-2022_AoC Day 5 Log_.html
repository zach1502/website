                Today's question was about arranging stacks of crates and moving N crates at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like all the other early questions, it is still simple. A notable roadblock though was that the input was hard to parse in C++. That slowed me down a bit.
                Unlike the previous questions, there was two inputs I had to read in. The first was the starting stack contents and the second was the moves to make.
                But once I got the input parsed, the rest was easy. It was the simple pops and pushes to and from a stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that you can move multiple crates at a time and the order will stay the same.
                but all that took to solve was a buffer stack to hold the crates and then pop them back into the destination stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a speedy 15:39 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 1601! Part 2 took 15:48 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 1014!
                The best results so far!

                I am now 12th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard, up from 14th.
                There are now 105 people in leaderboard,
