                So, I kinda forgot to write a blog post for yesterday, but I did complete the question. So its all good.
                Writing about 1 question is kinda short, so I will be writing about 2 questions today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Day 7's question was to find the total size of the directories with a total size of at most 100000.
                The challenge here was parsing and traversing the file system according to the commands given.
                When traversing a tree-like structure, its probably a recursive problem.
                So I wrote a recursive function that would traverse the tree and add up the sizes of the directories matching that criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that now, we want to delete the smallest directory given that our total space available is 70000000 and we need at least 30000000.
                So we needed to calculate the total size of the directories, sort them and figure out the smallest directory to delete that would satisfy the criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started late for day 7 so eh. 
                Part 1 took a recorded time of 2:35:55 (Rank 13930) and part 2 took 2:37:30 (Rank 12670).
            </p>

                Thanks Genshin Impact for being so addicting.

                Day 8's part 1 was to find how many trees are visible from the edge of a grid. Given a grid of values from 0-9 representing the height of a tree.
                A tree is visible if all other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it.

                Overall this was a pretty easy question. I wrote a function that would check if a tree is visible from the edge of the grid.
                Then I just looped through the grid and checked if each tree was visible.
                Of course, this is ridiculously inefficient, but I was going for speed here.
            </p>

            <p>
                Part 2's twist is now we have a heuristic, "Scenic Score", which is found by multiplying together its viewing distance in all 4 directions.
                We want to find the tree with the highest scenic score.
            </p>
            <p>
                This took a small modification to the part 1 function I wrote earlier, add 4 variables, 4 increments per loop and change the return type.
                and I was done in less than a minute.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a time of 17:38 (Rank 2529) and part 2 took 17:58 (Rank 606).
                A very strong performance for me. Maybe one day, I can be on the global leaderboard for a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now 10th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard, up from 12th! Which is kind of surprising given that I started 2 hours late on day 7.
                There are now 105 people in leaderboard.
