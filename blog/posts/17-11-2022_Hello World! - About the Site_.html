               <h2>Wow!</h2> 
            <p>
                You must be very impressed by this site. I know I am!
                The main purpose of this site is to <s>show off</s> 
                I mean, to talk about my experiences in some degree of detail and otherwise have fun and have something to actively maintain.
                The language and tone here won't be formal, just something semi-casual and unplanned writting.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a keen eye for detail. 
                You may have noticed that the site is built with mostly vanilla javascript and html.
                There's a few reasons for this: 
                <br>
                Faster loading times, Simplicity is best and, I can't afford to actually spend money for a host that can run a node.js server in the back.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case you were wondering, this is hosted on github pages. They will host your code on their servers for free but it doesn't come with a cPanel or anything like that.
                You can only host static sites on github pages. All it does is that it takes the HTML, CSS and, JavaScript files and just runs them.
            </p>

            <p>
                I got the inspiration to create a self-building website from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSyC8pxJdeQ">THIS</a> video.
                A video on how cranes build themselves. I thought it was really cool. I kept it in the back of my mind for a while. Months passed.
                A few days after I finished my midterm in CMPT 295 - Intro to Computer Systems (a notoriously difficult course).
                I wanted to start another project. Running through some ideas in my head, I remembered the crane video.

            <p>
                The first version of the main driver script (main.js) was extremely simplistic. 
                It simply reads text from a css file and puts it onto the page through the DOM.
                but it was a start.

                I then added more functionality. Starting with the ability to add text to the &lt;style&gt; tag. 
                Which is an important step to create the illusion of self-building.
                
                Of course, There's more to it than that. I had to add a few more features to make it look more code-like, convincing and user-friendly.
                Like RegEx matching, adjustable typing speed, a skip button and more.
                At that point in time, the code was super messy, but it works.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, I wasn't satisfied with the current state of the code. It was messy, hard to read and as a result it would be difficult to maintain.
                The second big refractor was to make the code more flexible and easier to read. 
                I made it so that when it reads in a line it will check for a prefix then it will hand over control to a command parser.
                Where it will parse the command and execute it.
                This made it so that I could modify the script that it follows freely.
                Whereas before it was hard-coded.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a little bit more work, tweaking, refractoring and, testing, I was satisfied with the current state of the code.
                So I then deployed the site to Github pages, attached some CI and Security checks and BAM! Site Launched.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had a lot of fun making it. Of course, there's still a lot of work to be done.
                Like making posts, adding more features, making it more user-friendly, increase support across devices and browsers and, etc.
                I was considering getting a domain name but until I get some income or something, I don't think I can afford it.
