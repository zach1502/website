            <p>
                The early questions are pretty easy, and it helps refresh my memory on the C++ standard library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today's question was about finding the common character in the 2 halves of a string and assign a value to it and then sum all the values. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My first instinct approach was to read in a line, split it in half, find the common character in a naive way, and then add the common character's value to the total.
                This question wasn't hard at all I thought I was done 4 minutes in but tragically, my approach had a flaw.
                Oddly enough, this approach did not work. I was getting the wrong answer. I debugged and debugged, but I couldn't find the problem.
                To the point I got two 5 minute submission cooldowns!
                I then remembered sets. Sets are a data structure that only contains unique elements. I then realized that I could use sets to find the common character.
                Which I did, and it worked magically.
                I still do not know why my initial approach didn't work, I could've reached the global leaderboard but I'm glad I found a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that you will now find the common character in a group of 3 strings. 
                This isn't a hard modification to make with my code. I just had to add a third set the set intersection and adjust the characters added to each set.
            </p>
            <p>
                So to sum up the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took sluggish 30:20 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 10879. Part 2 took 33:28 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 7466.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now 14th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard, down from 11th.
                There are now 103 people in leaderboard, 
                It's an okay result. At the very least I am still in the top 10% of the leaderboard. Which is my realistic goal.
                My ultimate goal of being number 1 is still a long way off, the people ahead of me are all experienced competitive programmers.
                I'm glad that I can somewhat keep pace with them.
            </p>
