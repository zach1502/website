                Today's question was about finding the first occurence of 4 unique letters in a long string.
            </p>
            <p>
                This question was a noticable difficulty drop from the last few questions, it wasn't all that hard to solve.
                I used a for loop to grab substrings of length 4 and then naively checked if they were unique using 2 for-loops.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that I am now looking for 14 unique letters in a string. I simply changed a few numbers and I was done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a brief 3:25 minutes to complete earning me rank 761! Part 2 took 4:47 minutes to complete thus getting me rank 1036!
                Back-to-Back better results! Hopefully I can keep that up!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now 12th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard, flat from 12th. But I closed the gap to 11th to 9 points!
                There are now 105 people in leaderboard.
