                Day 13's part 1 was about checking to see if a list of pairs of packets are in the right order.
                The packets contain lists and/or integers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was abandon my template. My instinct was to use Python instead and its (very unsafe) eval() function.
                It is fine since this is competitive programming but normally, I would try to avoid eval().
            </p>
            <p>
                Given each pair of packets, There are special rules to determine if the packets are in the right order.
                When comparing two values, if both are integers, the lower integer should come first.
                If both are lists, compare the lists' values in order. If the first list runs out of values, it is in the right order. Otherwise, it is not.
                If one is a list and the other is an integer, convert the integer to a list and perform a list-to-list comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all honesty, I really did not want to deal with parsing hell in C++. Using eval() was just so much easier!
                The overall question was pretty easy though. I just had to write a function that would compare two packets and return true or false.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that we need to sort all the packets in the right order. We also need to add in 2 special divider packets and place them in order.
                the product of the xth and yth position of these two packets is the solution we are looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, I was drawing a blank. Then I remembered something in C++'s std::sort() function. It can accept a lambda function as a parameter.
                I looked up to see if Python's sorting function had a similar feature and it did!
            </p>
            <p>
                An issue though was that it was expecting a key function, not a comparison function. 
                However after some googling, I found a way to convert a comparison function to a key function using functtools.cmp_to_key().
                After adjusting my comparison function to return 1, 0, or -1, I was able to use the key function to sort the packets.
                and part 2 was solved!
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a recorded time of 22:37 (Rank 1241) and part 2 took 24:55 (Rank 805).
            </p>

            <p>
                Day 14's part 1 was about simulating sand.
                The puzzle involves a certain rock configuration (the input) with the origin at the top left corner.
                Sand always drop from position 500,0 and falls down one by one. 
                Sand will fall straight down until it hits a rock or another sand particle.
                If it hits an obstacle, it will try to flow diagonally left or right, with left taking priority.
                Once it cannot flow left or right, it will stop. We assume that there is a limitless hole at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was to create a 2D array to represent the rock configuration.
                Then while 500,0 is not blocked, I will simulate the sand falling down. 
                If a sand particle goes lower that the lowest rock, I can safely assume that any more sand will fall into the indefinite hole.
                That is to say, there is an implicit "floor". 
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing this was fairly easy, although, it took me a little while to figure out how to read in the input in C++.
                I then counted the number of sand particles that were added and that was the answer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Part 2 is where I noticed I made a design mistake. The twist now was that there is now a floor 2 units below the lowest rock.
                The sand may now fall between x = -inf to inf.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a quick thought, I realized that I had to use a set of std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;s to represent the sand particles.
                This is because I needed to be able to handle negative x values AND I needed the flexibleness of the set in representing a grid.
                Note that I'm using an ordered set specifically because std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;s are not hashable.
            </p>
            <p>
                After overhaulling the representation, the rest was mostly trivial. I adjusted the cut off to be 2 units below the lowest rock and that was it!
                I took the number of particles that were added and bam, part 2 was solved!
            </p>

            <p>
                Part 1 took a time of 22:29 (Rank 913) and part 2 took 28:49 (Rank 1000).
                The best result so far!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am still 7th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard.
                The gap to 6th is 96 points and the gap to 8th is 83 points.
                There is now 107 people in leaderboard.
