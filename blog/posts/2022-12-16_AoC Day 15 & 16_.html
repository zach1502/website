            <p>
                So far these two puzzles are the most difficult ones. Especially day 16's which I will talk about in a little bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Day 15's puzzle was an interesting one, we are given a list of coordinates of many sensor's positions and it's closest beacon.
                The closest distance was measured in Manhattan distance. A very important detail that will help with the math later!
                Each sensor has a certain range, it spreads its signal out evenly in a diamond shape. Once it hits a beacon, it stops spreading.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to figure out, at y=2000000, How many spots do we know can not not have a beacon?
            </p>
            <p>
                To start off, I parsed the input into a vector of int* of specifically size 4. This vector contained the xy coordinates of the sensor and the coordinates of the closest beacon.
                For each int* of coordinates, I calculated how wide the sensor's signal was taking advantage of what the Manhattan distance was. 
                Then to calculate the spread of the signal, I took the manhattan distance earlier and subtracted it by, what y we wanted - the signal's y.

                If there just so happens to be a beacon at y=2000000, then we add that to a vector to be subtracted out of later.
            </p>
            <p>
                This gave me the half width of the signal from the sensor's x coordinate.
                I then added the half width to the sensor's x coordinate to get the right edge of the signal and subtracted the half width from the sensor's x coordinate to get the left edge of the signal.
                placed them together in a pair&lt;int, int&gt; and added it to a vector of pairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then, in hindsight, very inefficiently decided to create a set of &lt;int, int&gt; and move all the coordinates from the vector to the set.
                I returned that set.
                I then took the size of the set and subtracted the size of the vector of beacons and that was part 1's answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that there was precisely one spot that is not covered by any beacon's signal from x=0 to x=4000000 and y=0 to y=4000000.
                Now we need to find that spot. Our answer is x * 4000000 + y.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the moment that I realized that my approach to part 1 was very inefficient.
                Running the function 4000001 times on each y coordinate was just not going to work.
                So I decided to modify my original function.
            </p>
            <p>
                I already retrieve ranges of values that are covered by the signal, so I decided to take advantage of that.
                I removed the chunk converting the vector to a set and instead, I merged the ranges that overlapped until there was only 2 ranges left.
                I then ran it once more to try and merge the last 2 ranges.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there was only 1 range left, then I knew that there was no spot that was not covered by a beacon's signal and I kept going.
                If there was 2 ranges left, then I knew that there was a spot that was not covered by a beacon's signal.
                then the spot that was not covered by a beacon's signal was the right edge of the first range + 1.
                Calculating the answer was x * 4000000 + y but the number ended up being too big for any data type I had so I had to resort to using Window's calculator.
                Otherwise, this was a relatively smooth puzzle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a recorded time of 41:11 (Rank 2439) and part 2 took 42:35 (Rank 429)!
                My best result to date.
            </p>

            <p>
                Day 16's part 1 was about releasing as much pressure as possible from a system of valves.
                When we open a valve, we release some amount of pressure per minute. This process takes 1 minute.
                When we move to a different valve, this takes 1 minute.
                We want to find the maximum amount of pressure we can release in 30 minutes.
                All valves begin closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are given a list of valves, their pressure flow rate and what other valves can we travel to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recognized that this was a sort of graph problem, and in some ways, acted like a move tree.
                The first thing I recognized was that you can ignore opening the valves that released 0 pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of the time was spent on figuring out how to traverse the graph.
                I decided to use a recursive function that would only keep the best time we have.
                I also recognized that we are going to have to repeat many calculations, so I decided to use a map to store the results of the calculations.
                In otherwords, this was a dynamic programming problem and I used memoization to solve it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that we have 26 minutes now because we taught an elephant how to open valves.
                I like this story arc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amazingly, I did not have to change anything in my code to solve part 2.
                I iterated through all the valves the elephant and I could open and it worked out.
                Although, my previous attempt at part 2 was wrong because dynamic programming is hard sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a time of 1:35:46 (Rank 1364) and part 2 took 2:31:50 (Rank 788).
                A really large jump in difficulty.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now 6th on the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) leaderboard. Up from 7th.
                Thanks to a fair amount of people not being able to solve day 16's part 2.
                The gap to 5th is 78 points and the gap to 7th is 87 points.
                There is now 109 people in leaderboard.
