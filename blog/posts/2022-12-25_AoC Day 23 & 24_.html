                In part 1,
                We are given a number system named SNAFU, where the digits in base 10 is -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. 
                They are represented in this system as =, -, 0, 1, 2.
                I needed to sum a list of numbers in SNAFU and answer in SNAFU.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just converted everything to base 10 and then back to SNAFU.
                I performed something similar to base conversions in the past so I knew how to do it.
                Honestly there isn't much to write about this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2's twist was that there were no part 2! That was it! Merry Christmas!
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 1 took a time of 1:11:15 (Rank 2797) and part 2 took 1:11:22 (Rank 2232).
                Currently, I finished 4th in the CSSS leaderboard out of 109 participants.
                I was 45 points behind 3rd and 92 points ahead of 5th.
                Only 5 people have finished every question on time.
                Since there's still 5 more days for people to submit answers, the leaderboard will change a bit.

                As the holiday season approaches, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude to all of you who have followed my blog (most of whom being hiring managers lol). 
                Your engagement and encouragement have meant the world to me, and I'm so grateful to have such a wonderful community of readers. 
                As I look back on the past year, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities and experiences that have come my way. 
                I have had the chance to learn, grow, and connect with so many amazing people, and I am excited to see what the future holds. 
                As we enter the holiday season, I want to wish you all the joy, love, and cheer that this time of year brings. 
                May your holiday season be filled with warmth, laughter, and memorable moments with loved ones. 
                And as we look ahead to the new year, let's make a commitment to continue learning, growing, and making a positive impact in the world. 
                From me to all of you, happy holidays and a happy and prosperous new year. Merry Christmas!
