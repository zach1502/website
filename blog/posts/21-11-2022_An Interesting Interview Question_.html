                An Interesting Interview Question

            <p>
                A while back, early in my job search. I got not one, but two interviews with Intel!
                I was rather excited, because my friend was co-oping there.
                I was quite proud of myself! So much so that I decided to stop applying to other jobs cause I was so certain at least one of them would work out.
                That was a mistake, but not the goal of this post.
                Few days later, I was being interviewed by two engineers, named Eliot and Paulman.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the technical interview questions they asked me was:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Normally, we swap variables by using a temporary variable. But what if we didn't have a temporary variable? How would we swap two variables?"
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                After a bit of thought I answered "We can use the XOR operator".
            </p>

            <p>
                Apparently, both interviewers has never heard of using the XOR operator to swap variables.
                Despite both of them being senior engineers.
                I had to explain the solution to them.
                Not quite convinced when I explained verbally,
                so I had to prove it on the spot with a bit of pencil and paper.
                This was the proof I gave them:
            </p>
            <p>
                Let A and B be some number.
                XOR has 4 important properties:
            </p>
            <p>
                The commutative property, A XOR B = B XOR A.
            </p>
            <p>
                The associative property, A XOR (B XOR C) = (A XOR B) XOR C.
            </p>
            <p>
                There exists an identity, A XOR 0 = A.
            </p>
            <p>
                And there exists an inverse, A XOR A = 0.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if we have A and B, we can swap them by doing the following 3 operations:
            </p>
            <p>Operation #1: A = A XOR B</p>
            <p>
                A = A XOR B and B = B
            </p>
            <p>Operation #2: B = A XOR B</p>
            <p>
                A = A XOR B and B = B XOR (A XOR B)
            </p>
            <p>Using Associativity and Commutativity</p> 
            <p>
                A = A XOR B and B = (B XOR B) XOR A
            </p>
            <p>Simplify</p> 
            <p>
                A = A XOR B and B = A
            </p>
            <p>Operation #3: A = A XOR B</p>
            <p>
                A = A XOR B XOR A and B = A
            </p>
            <p>Using Commutativity</p>
            <p>
                A = (A XOR A) XOR B and B = A
            </p>
            <p>
                Simplify
            </p>
            <p>
                A = B and B = A
            </p>
            <p>
                And Done.
            </p>

            <p>
                I think they were quite impressed with my answer. It was actually better than the answer they had!
                Their answer used addition and subtraction. The issue with using addition and subtraction was that it could overflow.
                I was quite proud of myself for coming up with that solution on the spot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I had thought about the question a bit. I sent an email to one of the interviewers. 
                Laying out my exploration in thinking about how to swap two variables. Which I will lay out a TL;DR of here.
            </p>
            <p>
                All that is needed to swap two variables is to have the 4 properties I stated earlier. 
                The commutative property, the associative property, there exists an identity, and there exists an inverse.
                As long as the operation used has these properties. It can be used to swap two variables.
                As far as I know, you can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, XOR, and a 2 by 2 matrix to swap two variables.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I thought I did a pretty good job overall, I didn't get the co-op. I was a bit disappointed, but I was still proud of myself.
                because despite lacking experience, I taught them something new and novel to developers a lot more experienced than me.
                Just to note, in reality, you will probably never ever use something like this (unless you have a limited amount of registers). 
                The good old temporary variable is the best way to swap two variables.
                It is simply faster and easier to understand.
