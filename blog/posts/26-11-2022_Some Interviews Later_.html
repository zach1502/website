            <h2>TASKTOP</h2>
            <p>
                I've had a few more interviews since my last post.
                I've had one with TaskTop, and one with Clir Renewables.
                I'll talk about both of them here.
            </p>

            <p>
                TaskTop was a very interesting interview. I was interviewed by a really nice bearded fellow with a very nice voice.
                No joke, he had a really nice voice. It was very soothing. He also has a british accent.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the interview question was mostly about my experiences and projects. As expected.
                Oddly, this interview was the first I've had where there was no technical question!
                Well, there was one, but it was simply printing hello world in C++.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite that oddity, overall, the interview experience was really good.
                I learnt a little bit about the fact that the OSI is a suggestion, not a rule. You can send tcp through layer 2 if you want!
                He also recommended me to read the AGILE manifesto, which I have done and found to be interesting. Apparently, there are many variations of AGILE.
                This interview had to be the most relaxed interview I've had so far. 
            </p>

            <h2> Clir Renewables </h2>
            <p>
                My interview with Clir Renewables was a more traditional interview. I was interviewed by a nice lady as well as a handsome gent.
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, the interview went about like most of my other interviews. I was asked to introduce myself.
                Then answer some behavioral and value questions. Then a technical question.
                I do not think I explained myself well when performing the technical bit. 
                I'm normally not very lucid with my words and honestly, I do not think I did well in that department.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I would like to focus on the technical question. How I reached my answer, improvements I spotted while I was answering, and how I would answer it now.
            </p>
            
            <h3> The Question </h3>
            <blockquote>
                "Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.
                Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest.
                Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order."
            </blockquote>

            <h3> The Thought </h3>
            <p>
                Instantaneously, I recognize that a hashmap would be needed to store the frequency of each word. Since we need something that acts like a set and store an associated value.
                However, I didn't say that immediately.
                I had a thought that my first thought isn't good enough, thinking about what would happen after I've stored the frequency of each word.
                The rest of the steps seem kind of slow to me and I'm not sure if it's the best way to do it.
                So I tried to think up a better solution.
                I thought of using a priority queue, because it would be a good way to sort the words by frequency.
                The issue with that is that I didn't remember if priority queues allowed for a lambda function and I was also considering time complexity.
                Priority queues are O(log n) for insertion and O(1) for removal while hashmaps are O(1) for insertion and O(1) for removal.
            </p>

            <p>
                I felt I took too long thinking so I just basically said "Ight, I'll use a hashmap" and then I went on to explain how I would use a hashmap and got coding.
            </p>

            <p>
                So this hashmap would contain std::pair&lt;string, int&gt;s with the string being the word and the int being the frequency.
                I couldn't remember what was the map's default value so I simply assumed it was undefined/garbage.
                With that assumption, I set a word to 1 then increment it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next up is sorting the pairs. I thought okay, simple. I need to move all the pairs into a vector and then sort the vector.
                So now, let me tell you about an amazing thing. Library functions. The best thing ever.

                I used std::sort to sort the vector. But I sort of forgot how to use it. So I had to come up with some C-like psuedocode.
                (Its fine since they said it didn't need to be runnable).
                I know now that I can use a lambda function. Which is quite powerful.
            </p>

            <p>
                after that, I moved all the pairs into a vector and then erased the elements beyond the kth element.
                Then I moved all the elements into a vector and returned it.

                This solution was time complexity O(n * log n) with memory complexity of O(n).
            </p>

            <h3> The Improvements </h3>

            <p> So after I was done, I was asked. What are some improvements that you can make here.</p>
            <p> 
                I already knew where my errors were because it felt clunky when I was thinking about it. 
                I pointed to somewhere around the erase and a vector creation.
                "There's likely an optimization here because I do not think it is necessary to create 2 vectors. 
                It could save some memory and a bit of time. It won't change the complexity but it will make it more efficient."
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked about the optimal solution to this question after the interview. I was told that It was basically as good as it can be.
            </p>

            <h3> The New Answer </h3>
            <p> After the interview I worked on making the code actually work and this is what I got: </p>
            <pre>
vector&lt;string&gt; main(vector&lt;string&gt;& words, int k) {
    unordered_map&lt;string, int&gt; mp;
    
    for(auto word: words){
        mp[word]++;
    }
    
    vector&lt;pair&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; v;
    for(auto pairEl: mp){
        v.emplace_back(pairEl);
    }
        
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](pair&lt;string, int&gt; a, pair&lt;string, int&gt; b){
        if(a.second == b.second){
            return a.first &lt; b.first;
        }
        return a.second &gt; b.second;
    });
    
    vector&lt;string&gt; result;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; k; i++){
        result.emplace_back(v[i].first);
    }
    
    
    return result;
}
            </pre>
            <p>
                I tested this with some extreme cases and regular cases with words and k and it works fine.
                It is definitely an improvement to the one I gave in the interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may notice something weird, why emplace_back instead of push_back? 
                push_back creates a copy of the element and then moves it into the vector.
                emplace_back mostly does the same thing as push_back but it is more performant because it does not create redundant copies.
            </p>
            <p>
                you may also notice that I used a lambda function in std::sort. std::sort is a library function that normally sorts using the less than operator.
                However, you can put in a lambda function to sort by a different criteria. Which is what I wrote in psuedocode during the interview.
                I had to look up documetation to refresh my memory on lambdas.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is about it for this post. I hope you enjoyed it.
                I will be starting to prepare for finals instead of interviews and projects so I will dip in activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a new upcomming project that I planned to be comming out soon after finals. To impress an interviewer and recruiter, that is probably you!
