                Yes. I was going to study for my finals I said in the last post.
            </p>
            <p>
                What did I do instead? I started Advent of Code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to participate because I wanted to earn the coveted discord role @2022-Advent-of-Code-CHAMPION in the CSSS discord server.
                And also get an official letter of congratulations from the CSSS Executive team.
                I don't have many achievements so I thought I would aim for one.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to do the challenge in C++.
                The question for day 1 gave a list of numbers and empty lines. 
                You have to find the section of numbers whos sum is the largest.
                I had a bit of a shakey start because I forgot how to use stringstream.
                Otherwise it was one and done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part 2 asks you to find the maximum, 2nd maximum, and 3rd maximum sum of a section in the given blank-line separated list.
                This took very little thought to adjust my code and get the new answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Day 1 was a good start. I'm looking forward to the rest of the challenge.
                I finished part 1 in 7:09 and part 2 in 8:18. Earning me Rank 4018 for part 1 and Rank 2961 for part 2.
